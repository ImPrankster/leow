Henry.social is an app that gives you cashback on your online shopping and includes a smart AI assistant to help you find what you need. The platform became very popular, growing to a community of over 70,000 registered users.

### What I Did

My main role was to make the app look good and feel great to use.

**Web App (Website):**
I was in charge of the visual design and engineering for the website. I designed how everything looked and felt for users (except for the logo and fonts) and then wrote the code to make it work using Next.js. My goal was to make it fast and easy to use on any device, from phones to desktops.

**Mobile App (Phone):**
For the phone app, I built most of the features. I worked with the team on the overall design, and I wrote the code to bring it to life with React Native. I focused on making it feel smooth and natural to use.

### Technical Architecture

The project was built on a modern, scalable stack. We utilized a Turborepo-based monorepo to manage shared logic, components, and types, which significantly streamlined development between the Next.js and React Native apps. My work involved deep integration with our backend, built on Supabase and Node.js serverless functions, and connecting the UI to the AI features powered by LangChain.
