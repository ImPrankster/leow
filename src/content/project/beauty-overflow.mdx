Beauty OverFlow was my first project that explored the power of AI to revolutionize how people discover and choose beauty products. The goal was to create a functional prototype to showcase a new, smarter way to navigate the often-confusing world of skincare and cosmetics.

### The Inspiration

The inspiration for Beauty OverFlow came from a simple observation: the beauty market is overwhelming. I wanted to create a tool that could act as a personal, expert advisor, cutting through the noise of generic reviews and marketing to provide advice tailored to an individual's unique needs.

### My Role: From Concept to Functional Prototype

In this project, I was responsible for the design and the front-end engineering, taking the idea from a concept to a clickable, interactive prototype. I designed the entire user journey, from the visual layout of the personalized product recommendations to the conversational flow of the AI chat. I then engineered these designs into a functional web-based prototype, focusing on creating an intuitive user experience that made the powerful underlying AI feel simple and approachable. This involved building the interactive components and integrating the AI chatbot functionality to bring the concept to life.
