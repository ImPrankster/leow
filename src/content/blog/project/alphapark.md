## Project overview

[Link to site](https://alphapark.cc)

I built the MVP of a product recommendation website that uses AIGC to personalize the content for customers. I was responsible for designing the web app architecture, the full-stack development, as well as most of the researching & implementing LLM text generation & GAN image generation.

The website is built with Next.js, TRPC, Prisma & Tailwind CSS.
