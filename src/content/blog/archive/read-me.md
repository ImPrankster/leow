## Hi, I'm Leo Wang

This is the first blog on this brand-new, Astro-powered and blazingly-fast personal website.

### What will I use the website for?

It will be mainly used as an intro website for myself, a place to put down my thoughts as blog posts, and a place to showcase some of my projects.

### What am I working on recently?

I'm also competing in L'Or√©al's Brandstorm challenge, building a comprehensive wiki & community platform for the brand, check out at [https://brandstorm.loreal.com/](https://brandstorm.loreal.com/).
