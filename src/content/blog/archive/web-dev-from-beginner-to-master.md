- Web pages are stored on the client computer.
- We usually call the home page "home.html".

HTML Section

- HTML is a programming language.
- HTML tags don't have to come in pairs.
- `<title></title>` is placed in the `<head></head>` section.
- You use `<link></link>` to create a hyperlink.
- `<h1></h1>` is the largest heading tag.

## Set up your dev tools

- Make sure you have an editor (We are using VSCode here), a terminal, and a browser installed and set up.

## Create your first website

### Set up the files

**_Hands on time!_**

Let's do it fully inside a terminal.

- Create a folder called `my-first-website`
- Create a file called `index.html` inside the folder
- Create a file called `style.css` inside the folder
- Create a file called `script.js` inside the folder

### Serving the files

Like we said, we need a browser to see our website. But we also need a server to serve our files.

In this case, we will be starting a server on our computer.

Live Server is a VSCode extension that will serve our files for us.

**_Hands on time!_**

- Install Live Server
- Start the server

### HTML

**_Hands on time!_**

- Open `index.html` in your editor
- add a basic HTML template
- add a title
- add a heading "Hello World!"

Now you can see your website in the browser! How cool is that!

A great resource I recommend everyone to use for looking up any HTML tags as well as CSS and JavaScript syntax is [W3CSchools](https://www.w3schools.com)

Let's add more things to the simple web page.

Add a `<Image/>`

Add a `<Button></Button>` That says "Press me"

### CSS

**CSS Selectors**

CSS's syntax is very simple. It's just a selector followed by a list of rules.

Element selector

```
p{

  }
```

Class selector

```
.this-is-a-class{

  }
```

ID selector

```
#id{

}
```

_More selector usage, you can check W3CSchools._

We use different selectors for different abstraction level of our styling.

And how do we apply the styles to the html

```
<p class="class-a class-b class-c" id="myP1"></p>
```

An HTML element can have multiple classes, but only one id

**CSS Rules**

There are tons of CSS rules out there, you don't have to remember all of them.

Some examples of rules you will see everyday:

```
background-color: defines the background color of an element.
color: defines the color of an element.
border: a shorthand(collection) of border styles
margin: defines the margin of an element.
padding: defines the padding of an element.
```

Everything in CSS is a box!

For things that are not shaped like a box like texts, think of it as always having a imaginary box containing it.

**_Hands on time!_**

Let's make a colorful webpage!

- Add background color to the headings you have.
- Change the padding and margin to make the webpage more readable.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is the only way (for now) for the client browser to be interactive and can fetch data dynamically.

JavaScript Baaaaasic:

```
console.log()
alert()
Date()
```

**JavaScript HTML DOM**

What makes JavaScript useful is that it can manipulate the HTML DOM. DOM stands for the Document Object Module, which defines what you see on the browser.

How to manipulate DOM?

[W3CSchools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)

Key methods and properties:

```
document.getElementById(Id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.getElementsByClassName(name)
element.innerHTML
element.attribute
```

JavaScript event and event listener:

[W3CSchools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_events.asp)

**_Hands on time!_**

- Create a button on the page with the function to display the current date on it.
- Change the texts on your headings to the things you want to say.

**JavaScript Async**

Finally, the most important (and probably the hardest) topic of today.

[W3CSchools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_callback.asp)

A important aspect of Web Dev is data fetching, and till now we have not talked about it.

Syncing data, it takes time, that's why we need to use async functions.

**_Hands on time!_**

- Let's write a function to fetch data from an API and display it on the page.
- We will use [this API](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random) to fetch a random joke.
- Display the joke on the page, after it is fetched.
- Finish up the workshop by adding some styling to the page.
