## Hi, I'm Leo Wang

I'm a uni student living in Shanghai. I enjoy web / game development and also graphic and interface design. This blog is for documenting various stuff I'm working on as well as sharing random thoughts. I had two blog websites previously and all the blogs are ported to this one. To view the archived website, visit: [ImPrankster's personal blog](https://imprankster.vercel.app) [Leo Wang's personal blog](https://im-leo-wang.vercel.app). You can find me on GitHub as well as LinkedIn.

## My Tech Stack

My preferred language for Web dev is TypeScript, mainly with node.js, but I'm also exploring deno and bun as well. My go-to framework is Next.js, it's powerful, well-supported, and getting better every day. I also like Solid and Svelte, tho. Tailwind CSS is also one thing I absolutely love and use a lot. The various service provider I use are Vercel for serverless deployment, PlanetScale / Supabase for db, and Clerk for user auth.
