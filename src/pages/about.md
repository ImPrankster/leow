## Hi, I'm Ruofan Wang (Goes by Leo as well)

I'm a CS student studying at NYU. I do web development and also graphic & interface design. I'm a huge transit nerd and loves travelling to different cities. I love playing video games (I play indie action RPG/FPS/anything with a chill vibe). This blog is for documenting various stuff I'm working on as well as sharing random thoughts.

Things I'm learning: Typography Design, Mobile Development (With Native Swift on iOS & React Native), German

Find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/leow.io), [GitHub](https://github.com/ImPrankster)

Language: English, Mandarin Chinese
