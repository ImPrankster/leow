## 大家好，我是王若帆 Hi, I'm Ruofan Wang

I'm a CS student studying at NYU. You can also call me Leo. I do web development and also graphic & interface design. I'm a huge transit nerd and loves travelling in different cities. Also, I'm a huge video game nerd (RPG/FPS/Indie Games/anything with a chill vibe). This blog is for documenting various stuff I'm working on as well as sharing random thoughts.

Things I'm learning:

- Typography Design
- Mobile Development
- German

Find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/leow.io), [GitHub](https://github.com/ImPrankster)

I speak Mandarin Chinese and English
